        <h2>What will I be involved in?</h2>
        <p>We're so happy you asked that! Typically on a day to day basis might be involved in any or all these
          activities:</p>
        <ul class="text-gray-700 leading-8 font-semibold">
          <li>Shape and build new features for our products (RedRabbit & Rams)</li>
          <li>Find innovative ways to make the solutions better, faster & more secure.</li>
          <li>Take ownership & and drive the implementation of your ideas.</li>
          <li>Improve existing code bases by fixing bugs and refactoring code.</li>
          <li>Work with our management, customer success and business development teams to identify and solve new
            challenges.
          </li>
          <li>Research & stay up to date with technology trends.</li>
          <li>Study to improve your skills or learn new skills.</li>
          <li>Make great coffee...</li>
          <li>Drink great coffee...</li>
          <li>Have some wine and boerewors rolls on the odd lazy Friday afternoon</li>
          <li>Repeat & have fun :)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course this is a non-exhaustive list and there are a lot of other smaller things like participating
          in our betting tables where we have all the teams bet on features to include in the next cycle. If this sounds
          weirds... It's because we don't follow your typical SCRUM or AGILE methodologies. We're avid believers in
          not always doing things the way everybody else is doing which is why we decided to follow the lead of one of
          the most successful SaaS companies we know, Basecamp. Their development process is called shapeup and you can
          read
          more about it <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup" target="_blank">HERE</a> if you are interested.</p>
        <h2>What technologies will I typically be working with?</h2>
        <p>We know that there is a bit of a stigma around PHP... but that ship has actually sailed and PHP has become
          a very fast robust language, and if you apply proper object oriented principles you can write some pretty
          amazing stuff with it. </p>
        <p>So yeah, our backends are mostly PHP, Laravel. If you haven't heard of Laravel yet,
          you can check it out <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
          It's just one of the fastest growing web frameworks with the most intelligent and
          awesome community that will most likely take over the world in the next few years. Yes... it's that amazing.
          However we do use quite a number of other technologies on a day to day basis so there is plenty of opportunity
          to learn new things and become a better full stack developer. Here's a high level summary of the things we use
          almost on a daily basis:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-gray-700 leading-8 font-semibold">
          <li>PHP Laravel Framework</li>
          <li>Javascript VueJS framework</li>
          <li>TailwindCSS</li>
          <li>MySQL & Aurora Databases</li>
          <li>Amazon Webservices (EC2, S3, ECS, ELB, RDS, Lambda, etc.)</li>
          <li>Git version control via Github</li>
          <li>Git Actions for our CI/CD pipelines</li>
          <li>Docker Containerization</li>
          <li>Composer & Npm package managers</li>
          <li>Flutter / Java Android / IOS SWIFT</li>
          <li>Jetbrains Webstorm IDEs</li>
          <li>& Basecamp for Project Management</li>
        </ul>
